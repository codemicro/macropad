# Firmware

## rev0

### Requirements

* [CircuitPython 6](https://circuitpython.org/)
* The `lib` folder either
  * from Adafruit's [CircuitPython library bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle)
  * or as generated by [`bundler`](https://github.com/codemicro/picoTools/tree/master/bundler) according to `rev0/bundler.json`.

### Installation

1. Install CircuitPython
2. Copy the `*.py` files from `rev0` and your `lib` folder onto your board
3. Reboot your board

### Modifying

#### For other hardware:

Pin mappings are defined in `rev0/pins.py`. These can be modified to support either a different PCB design or completely different microcontroller.

#### For your own macros:

Macros are defined in `rev0/user_mappings.py`. Comments in that file *should* explain how everything works.
